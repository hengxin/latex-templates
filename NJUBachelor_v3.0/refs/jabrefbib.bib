  abstract = {Picosecond optical excitation was used to coherently control the excitation
	in a single quantum dot on a time scale that is short compared with
	the time scale for loss of quantum coherence. The excitonic wave
	function was manipulated by controlling the optical phase of the
	two-pulse sequence through timing and polarization. Wave function
	engineering techniques, developed in atomic and molecular systems,
	were used to monitor and control a nonstationary quantum mechanical
	state composed of a superposition of eigenstates. The results extend
	the concept of coherent control in semiconductors to the limit of
	a single quantum system in a zero-dimensional quantum dot.},

  abstract = {Photoluminescence blinking—random switching between states of high
	(ON) and low (OFF) emissivities—is a universal property of molecular
	emitters found in dyes1, polymers2, biological molecules3 and artificial
	nanostructures such as nanocrystal quantum dots, carbon nanotubes
	and nanowires4, 5, 6. For the past 15 years, colloidal nanocrystals
	have been used as a model system to study this phenomenon5, 6. The
	occurrence of OFF periods in nanocrystal emission has been commonly
	attributed to the presence of an additional charge7, which leads
	to photoluminescence quenching by non-radiative recombination (the
	Auger mechanism)8. However, this ‘charging’ model was recently challenged
	in several reports9, 10. Here we report time-resolved photoluminescence
	studies of individual nanocrystal quantum dots performed while electrochemically
	controlling the degree of their charging, with the goal of clarifying
	the role of charging in blinking. We find that two distinct types
	of blinking are possible: conventional (A-type) blinking due to charging
	and discharging of the nanocrystal core, in which lower photoluminescence
	intensities correlate with shorter photoluminescence lifetimes; and
	a second sort (B-type), in which large changes in the emission intensity
	are not accompanied by significant changes in emission dynamics.
	We attribute B-type blinking to charge fluctuations in the electron-accepting
	surface sites. When unoccupied, these sites intercept ‘hot’ electrons
	before they relax into emitting core states. Both blinking mechanisms
	can be electrochemically controlled and completely suppressed by
	application of an appropriate potential.},

	high contrast photon antibunching by using optical upconversion of
	the excited state population of the 4f↔4f optical transition into

	of Pr3+ ions in a bulk yttrium aluminium garnet crystal by patterned
	ion implantation. Finally, we show generation of local nanophotonic
	structures and cell death due to photochemical effects caused by
	upconverted ultraviolet fluorescence of praseodymium-doped yttrium
	aluminium garnet in the surrounding environment. Our study demonstrates
	versatile use of rare-earth atomic-size ultraviolet emitters for
